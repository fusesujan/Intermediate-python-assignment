### Type Hinting

<p>
Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the interpreter determines the type of variables at runtime.
However, adding type hinting in basic examples or even larger projects offers several benefits:

- Readability and Documentation
- Static Type Checking
- IDE Support
- Code Maintenance
- Team Collaboration

###### While type hinting is optional in Python, adopting it in your codebase can improve code quality, maintainability, and readability, especially in larger and more complex projects. In small and simple examples, the benefits may not be as apparent, but as the codebase grows, the advantages of type hinting become more evident.
